Last week [Logan Dwight](https://medium.com/u/568c2ecc7fee), [hellojarreau](https://medium.com/u/96e814ef9e61), and I represented [The Soap Collective](http://www.thesoapcollective.com) (and VR) at the IMPACT 2016 conference down in San Diego, CA. Over the course of just a few days, we introduced virtual reality to hundreds of attendees composed of financial services professionals ranging from their late twenties to early fifties. With this audience in mind, we curated eight experiences from various developers using three Samsung Gear VRs, two HTC Vives, and one Oculus Rift. Below are some of the notes I gathered on people’s reactions.

The experiences we showcased:

-   **Samsung Gear VR**: [_Ocean Rift_](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1249878741704255/), [_Gunjack_](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/969815736436279/), [_Smash Hit_](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/942006482530009/)
-   **HTC Vive**: [_Project CARS_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/234630/), [_Gunjack_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/410570/), [_Hoops_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/487770/), [_Everest_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/384750/)
-   **Oculus Rift**: [_Eagle Flight_](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1003772722992854/), [_The Climb_](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/866068943510454/)

-   Almost everyone knew of Google Cardboard, and several had heard of the Oculus Rift. Many didn’t know the difference between the Rift and the Gear VR. Few had heard of the Vive.
-   For those apprehensive to trying VR for the first time, **their biggest fear was motion sickness**. In most cases, we were able to combat this by starting them in a light-weight experience (Ocean Rift).
-   The only experience we brought that made some people feel queasy was _Project CARS_. Even when someone felt queasy, they still thought it was awesome.
-   When given the option to try high-end or mobile VR, most people didn’t care about the difference in fidelity or level of immersion. They only cared about what the experience was and whether it was something they wanted to do.
-   Roughly 40% of the people that tried out VR were women.
-   More women than men came out of a VR experience excited and ready to buy a VR device.
-   Most people that wanted to get a Gear VR asked if it supported an iPhone.
-   **The importance of the environment cannot be overstated.** A majority of people that tried _The Climb_ took the first 30 seconds to admire the view before they started climbing.
-   _The Climb_ was a huge success for both people that have actually gone rock climbing and those that haven’t.
-   **Trying to get someone to learn a new movement is hard.** In _Eagle Flight_, a person is supposed to change direction by tilting their head rather than turning their head. Very few people tilted their head, even when a large message in the center of their view told them to.
-   When immersed, people generally ignored on screen messages. Both _Project CARS_ and _Eagle Flight_ have on screen UI or messages that pop up, and a majority of people ignored them to focus on the task at hand (driving or flying).
-   You can tell how immersed someone is in a Vive or Rift experience by how sweaty the controllers get. We had to use a lot of disinfectant wipes throughout the conference.
-   In _Everest_, we had people walk across a chasm with a ladder. This was too real for almost everyone. They were either extremely excited or completely horrified.
-   Overall amongst all experiences we had: 5 people scream, 2 people fall over, and 1 person kick over a table.
-   **When demoing VR, always give the person the controller(s) first so they can feel the buttons before they put the headset on.**
-   For non-gamers, Xbox controllers are complicated. We specifically chose experiences that required no more than two buttons (the left and right triggers).
-   **Standing experiences are tricky for first time VR users**, especially if the experience is meant to parallel a real physical activity. People that wanted to do _The Climb_ standing often tried to lean forward to rest on the VR cliff.
-   People don’t like needing to hold their arm up to tap the side of the Gear VR. Those that played _Gunjack_ or _Smash Hit_ often asked if they could use a controller instead.
-   My favorite reaction was someone who didn’t quite know how to handle how awesome VR was. They just kept laughing and saying, “No way, no way!”
-   It’s hard to accommodate people with glasses in the Vive and the Rift. If they have large rimmed glasses that didn’t fit (the Vive was slightly more forgiving), they often had to just deal with blurry vision in VR.
-   It’s important for developers to _strictly_ honor the Vive’s chaperone bounds. In _Everest,_ people are often required to step just outside the bounds, which resulted in people bumping into things.
-   **People like watching other people try VR.** For every person we put in a headset there was one or two people that just wanted to watch.
-   By the last day of the conference, everyone that came to try out VR told us they were referred by a colleague who said, “You gotta go to the VR booth!”

All-in-all we had a ton of fun showing off this many experiences to so many VR first timers! It was a great opportunity to chat with and learn how people outside of the VR industry perceive and respond to virtual reality.
