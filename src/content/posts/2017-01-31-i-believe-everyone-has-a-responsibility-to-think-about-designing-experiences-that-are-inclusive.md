I believe everyone has a responsibility to think about designing experiences that are inclusive. With that said, I think asking who is responsible for holding someone or some company up to this standard is a more nuanced discussion. There are many variables that go into designing and developing for inclusivity that need to be considered: the size of the team, production schedule, budget, what the experience is, and who the target audience is, just to name a few.

What I believe could be very useful for the VR industry right now, is coming up with/discussing a framework for how to think about inclusive design in VR. This can empower developers, and studios small to large, to think about what tradeoffs they are making when considering one design decision vs another. Here are a few examples:

- How do you design an agnostic avatar?
- What does avatar customization look like for different genders, ages, races, etc?
- How complicated are the movements in your VR experience and do they limit the number of people that can participate?
- How will your experience differ when played with a room scale setup vs standing vs seated?
- What would this experience be like if you are color blind or deaf?

These are just a few of the questions that I, and everyone at The Soap Collective, think about regularly. We have been working on our own internal process for designing inclusive VR, and we plan on sharing more of what we’ve come up with soon!
