title: The HTC Vive is Only $799!

Let’s get real for a second. When the Oculus pre-orders launched and it was priced at $599, people freaked out. Yet, this is an inexpensive starting price for such powerful technology (not to mention only $1,500 to bundle it with a powerful computer). Oculus will not be making money off of $599 for the Rift, but they are setting the cost landscape for their two main competitors: the Vive and PlayStation VR.

Recently, HTC announced the pre-order cost and release for the Vive, and _damn_ they did a much better job at being competitive than I thought they were going to be. Both the Rift and the Vive is tech that could easily be priced at the $1k+ mark. Oculus decided to get to market sooner and at a reasonable price so they did two things: 1) They are shipping with only one tracking sensor and 2) They are _not_ shipping with their Touch Controllers.

This has left a much needed opening for HTC to be competitive. They have a more difficult sell in that it’s “room scale” VR and their brand recognition is just flat out behind Oculus once you extend outside VR enthusiasts. For a mere $200 more than the Rift, the Vive comes with an extra tracking sensor _and_ two hand tracking controllers. This is huge! Once Oculus allows the purchasing of their Touch Controllers and an additional sensor, we’ll be lucky if they don’t add an additional $200 to the total price. Not only is the Vive launching as a complete VR package, HTC will start fulfillment less than a month after Oculus. So the only real concern is, will the Rift pre-orders affect those that would have pre-ordered the Vive had it launched at it’s original timeline?

I pre-ordered a Rift, I will pre-order a Vive on Monday. And I’m still awaiting for Sony’s official announcement later this year so I can pre-order PlayStation VR. 2016 is an exciting year for VR!
