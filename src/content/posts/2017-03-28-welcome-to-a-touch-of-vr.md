The virtual reality industry is growing rapidly. As the CEO & Technical Director of [The Soap Collective](http://www.thesoapcollective.com/), I spend a lot of time in and around VR. Everyday, I’m either helping [create fantastic worlds](http://www.EnterAtlas.com) for people to explore, [attending VR panels](https://blog.thesoapcollective.com/highlights-from-vr-film-meetups-storytelling-in-vr-panel-at-upload-collective-52e2358b4382), or playing many of the rapidly growing library of experiences from other developers.

There is a lot of new information coming out daily, and it can be overwhelming to try and sort it all out. Through the _A Touch of VR_ newsletter, I hope to ease that pain. I’ll be sending an email once a week with three links that I think are important or noteworthy. These links will vary in nature to include VR thought pieces, industry news/announcements, new experiences for you to try (from 360 video to high-end HMDs), and more.

If you want to keep your pulse on the VR industry in the simplest way possible, sign up for the newsletter below:
