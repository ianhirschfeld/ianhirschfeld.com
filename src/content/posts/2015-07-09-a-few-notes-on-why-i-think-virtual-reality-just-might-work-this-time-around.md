title: A few notes on why I think Virtual Reality just might work this time around.

There was a slight uproar recently when renowned game designer, [Warren Spector](https://twitter.com/warren_spector), reiterated his cautious outlook on Virtual Reality (VR) in a [recent interview](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-06-23-warren-spector-on-e3-vr-is-a-fad). His comments included, “VR is a fad” and “everyone looks stupid in a VR headset”. He even published a [blog post](https://warrenspector.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/so-lets-talk-about-vr/) on the subject. I believe it’s important to take note when someone respected in your field (or related field) takes a strong stance against something new. A few months ago my company, [The Soap Collective](http://www.thesoapcollective.com), made the leap to become a full-stop agency for creating virtual reality experiences. In doing so, I’ve been attending as many VR meetups and events as I can. I soon discovered that there are actually quite a number of people that share Mr. Spector’s skepticism, and so I wanted to take a moment and explain why I’m such a believer.

Below are some of the common resistances to VR I hear, why I still think VR will “work”, and a few of the questions that do keep me up at night:

#### “VR is a fad”

This one is common, and rightly so. VR has come and gone more than once already, and better/cheaper tech is NOT the silver bullet to making a market (although I do think it’s the foundation, more on that at a later time). The biggest reason I don’t think VR is a fad, is because it has the potential to solve real problems across a plethora of industries. For instance, helping people [overcome their phobias](http://psious.com/), giving children a more [engaging education](http://immersivediscovery.com/), or building empathy through [immersive journalism](https://emblematicgroup.squarespace.com/emblematic-immersive-journalism/). These companies are all young, but the seed of their ideas are incredibly powerful and can’t be achieved unless VR is viable.

#### “People look stupid wearing VR headset”

This is another common knock against VR. However, “looking stupid” is a subjective measurement. We commonly mistake new types of activity, fashion, or language as stupid when we haven’t given it a chance to settle in, or didn’t grow up with it. There are countless things we do already that one could argue “look stupid”. Taking a selfie, eating lobster with a bib, and dancing just to name a few. And yet people still enjoy doing all of those. Wearing a headset for VR might look stupid to some now, but within the next five years it’ll become common place.

#### “People will always get sick”

This argument has actually quieted some over the past year, but it is still worth addressing. Will some people get sick with VR? Definitely. But there are still plenty of people that get sick on cars, boats, and airplanes. Will the majority of people always be on the verge of barfing while using VR? Definitely not. This is purely a technology and developer education problem. The tech in it’s current form has come a long way in combating motion sickness, and the consumer HMDs coming out next year are going to be even better. The other half the of sickness equation is developers learning what to do, and more importantly what NOT to do, when building a VR experience. This too has been progressing, and as UX standards for VR emerge you’ll start to see fewer and fewer cases of people feeling sick.

#### “VR won’t stick because it’s too solitary”

While it’s true that the allure of presence in VR requires you blocking out all sound and image from the real world, this does not mean your experience will be solitary. If anything, video games and the internet have very much shown us that meaningful shared experiences can happen between two people facing a screen sitting on opposite ends of the world. Whatever VR becomes over the years, you can safely bet social experiences will be a part of it. This could be multiplayer games, virtual classrooms, or just hanging out in the [OASIS](http://www.weirdcatalog.com/ci/ready-player-one).

#### “VR is temporary until AR comes around”

It’s easy to clump VR and Augmented Reality (AR) together because they are both future tech, and they are both getting a lot of hype through the same circles of people. However, they are still fundamentally different and will solve different solutions. VR at its core is about escapism. It’s about achieving presence in a world other than our own. AR is about enhancing what you already see. It’s about making the world around you “better” through visual augmentation. AR won’t replace VR because AR doesn’t allow you to travel to knew worlds and experience things outside your reach. At the same time, VR won’t make AR useless because VR doesn’t let you still be in the real world while you use it. Both are upcoming technology and both will be viable and solve their own unique problems.

### So, what are some of real obstacles in the way of VR coming to fruition?

All of the above isn’t to say there aren’t hurdles. For virtual reality to not just fade away again, there are still some important things the industry needs to figure out. Here are a few that I think about often:

#### How do we make sure the first wave of VR hardware and content is consumer friendly?

I trust the larger companies will work out the hardware part, and what I’ve experienced so far is promising. The GearVR was pleasant and easy to use, Sony’s Morpheus was incredibly polished, and Oculus CV1 looks like it will be great. Here’s what needs to happen during year 1 of consumer VR: the HMDs nees to comfortable, the input devices need to be intuitive, and the discovery platforms need to be accessible.

My bigger concern is the content. This area definitely needs some work. Year 1 needs to see much more polished experiences emerging on the GearVR and Oculus Share. Luckily, many developers are working on this right now. This is also part of why [The Soap Collective](http://www.thesoapcollective.com) is entering the space. Our team has a background in game design, animation, software development, and storytelling. We hope to bring our experience into the growing VR industry by creating some of best experiences available.

#### How do we spread VR outside of gaming?

It makes complete sense both Oculus and Sony will be targeting gamers as the early market adopters of VR. Gamers have a history of being okay with trying new technology, and more importantly, paying for it. However, if VR is pegged as “gaming hardware” early on, I’m afraid that will dramatically slow down mass consumer adoption. My hope is that Oculus, Sony, Samsung, Google, and others will quickly put support behind the growing number of non-gaming VR companies out there. Let the money come in through video games, while making sure money is spent on supporting VR in other industries.

#### How do we create standards quickly enough to encourage adoption but slowly enough so it doesn’t stifle innovation?

Part of the problem with VR having a spotlight so early on, is there’s not a whole lot of time for experimentation. From a content perspective, there is currently a lot of not-so-great stuff you can download for the Oculus. This is primarily due to developers still learning how to build for VR and experimenting with the different input devices available. Standards would help a lot of these developers out. The sooner VR experiences have some sort of UX and hardware standards, the sooner consumers can feel comfortable with jumping in and using them.
