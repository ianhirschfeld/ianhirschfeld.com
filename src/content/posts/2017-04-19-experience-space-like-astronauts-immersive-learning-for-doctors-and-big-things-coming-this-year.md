### [SpaceX is taking SpaceVR’s cameras into orbit to deliver the astronaut experience to everyone through VR](http://mashable.com/2017/04/15/spacevr-spacex/#HWdyf_UzEgq4)

It’s really cool to see VR being used to bring new perspectives to people. From SpaceVR’s CEO, Ryan Holmes:

> “When \[astronauts\] go into space, they have this really deep, emotional feeling, it’s almost like they’re awakening to the universe… I saw them as being much better people, much more connected to other people \[as a result of\] seeing our place in the universe. I realized that once that happens to everyone, we’ll fundamentally live in a different world as a species, because we’ll all think differently. My goal is to catalyze that \[astronaut experience\] by sending this VR camera into space so people can really see what it’s like.”

The University of Nebraska Medical Center is getting a major facility upgrade that will include various immersive learning environments. From UNMC Chancellor Jeffrey Gold, MD:

> “Learners do best by having experience, whether it’s learning how to play a sport, a musical instrument or, in my case, do cardiac surgery. The more experience, the more practice, the more hands-on opportunities we get, the better off we are to deliver high quality, safe, effective and patient-centered care. This center will achieve all of those goals and continue to bring Nebraska to the epicenter of the learning world.”
