A curated collection of high-quality games, movies, TV, music, books, comics, and internet stuff. Celebrate the colorful, creative, and strange.

Today, [The Soap Collective](http://www.thesoapcollective.com) is proud to announce the release of [Weird Catalog](http://www.weirdcatalog.com)! What is Weird Catalog? Well, it’s a discovery site of some of the coolest, weirdest media that we’ve come across.

We absorb a lot of different media ranging from movies, tv, and comics to music, apps, and games. Over the years we’ve collected a lot of really “weird” media. We’ve found that there is a lot of high-quality fun, cool, and deep weird out there. So we decided to build a site where we could curate and share the content we’ve enjoyed.

Here is a sample of some weird media that may have slipped under your radar:
