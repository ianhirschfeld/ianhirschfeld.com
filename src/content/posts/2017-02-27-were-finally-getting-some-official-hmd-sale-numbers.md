There has been a lot of chatter so far this year that the virtual reality industry was “humbled”, and that VR didn’t take off the way the industry expected. However, as hardware makers and researchers continue to release numbers on engagement, investment, and HMD sales, I believe we are getting a picture of a successful first consumer year of VR. Here’s what we have so far:

## Official Numbers

### [PlayStation VR (915,000](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/business/sony-playstation-vr-sales.html))

Andrew House of Sony Interactive Entertainment revealed that as of February 19th, PSVR has sold nearly one million units of their HMD.

### [Samsung Gear VR (5,000,000](http://venturebeat.com/2017/01/04/samsung-confirms-it-sold-5-million-gear-vr-mobile-headsets/))

With highest sales, the Gear VR is the most widely owned HMD on the market (apart from Google Cardboard). Mobile VR, having the most affordable headsets, offers the industry the best chance at early market penetration.

## Research Numbers

For the other big players in the space, all we have to go on is market research and estimations. From [Unity’s 2016 Market Report](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/02/01/cant-stop-wont-stop-the-2016-mobile-games-market-report/) and SuperData Research:

-   HTC Vive (420,000)
-   Oculus Rift (240,000)
-   Google Daydream (260,000)

## What can we expect for 2017?

All-in-all we are looking at roughly 6.8 million mobile to high-end HMDs out on the market, and this doesn’t include Google Cardboard, OSVR, and other secondary HMDs in markets such as China. The best part is, we know exactly what we need to do to get these numbers to continue to grow: keep lowering the barrier of entry to HMDs and create compelling content / apps that drive usage.

I foresee continued growth from the Gear VR, Daydream, and PSVR due to their high accessibility and affordability. Meanwhile, I see the Vive and Rift growing slowly as a majority of developers and VR enthusiasts already purchased these HMDs. I don’t expect mass market consumers buying into high-end VR until it is less expensive, has smaller/lighter industrial design, and doesn’t require a high-end PC. I’m excited to see what comes of Windows 10 compatible HMDs as they potentially serve the same market as PSVR.
